<!-- This page contains simple form, with each field in separate cell in a table. Geared to post to '/'.
     Marked as being backed up by the personForm object we saw in GET method in web controller, AKA
     "bean-backed form". Two fields in the PersonForm bean: th:field="*{name}" and th:field="*{age}".
     Next to each field is a secondary element that is used to show any validation errors.

     Also have button that submits form. If user enters name or age that violates @Valid constraints, it
     will bounce back to this page with error message displayed. If valid input entered, routed to next web
     page.
