Validating Form Input
This guide walks you through the process of configuring a web application form to support validation.

What You Will Build
You will build a simple Spring MVC application that takes user input and checks the input by using standard validation annotations. You will also see how to display the error message on the screen so that the user can re-enter input to make it be valid.
